Pick a directory

Go through all files in the directory

Read each one

Look for match


Matching text

Extracting text

Making things happen in parallel

----
When we pick the directory, get the map
When we search, execute the search

Read a PDF
Memory management -> how much do we need/want to allocate? Do we have enough to open this file?
If the file is too big, open it in chunks, have it go through once, then change the size of the chunks and do it again

So now what? Build a UI, no?
